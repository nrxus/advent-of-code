Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; the easiest ones take 3-4 hours each, but the
harder ones take 6-8 hours, and a few even longer than that. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 6: Probably a Fire Hazard ---</h2><p>Because
 your neighbors keep defeating you in the holiday house decorating 
contest year after year, you've decided to deploy one million lights in a
 <span title="Hey, be glad I'm not asking for the resistance between two points!">1000x1000 grid</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because you've been especially nice this year, Santa has
 mailed you instructions on how to display the ideal lighting 
configuration.</p>
<p>Lights in your grid are numbered from 0 to 999 in each direction; the lights at each corner are at <code>0,0</code>, <code>0,999</code>, <code>999,999</code>, and <code>999,0</code>. The instructions include whether to <code>turn on</code>, <code>turn off</code>, or <code>toggle</code>
 various inclusive ranges given as coordinate pairs.  Each coordinate 
pair represents opposite corners of a rectangle, inclusive; a coordinate
 pair like <code>0,0 through 2,2</code> therefore refers to 9 lights in a 3x3 square.  The lights all start turned off.
</p><p>To defeat your neighbors this year, all you have to do is set up your lights by doing the instructions Santa sent you in order.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>turn on 0,0 through 999,999</code> would turn on (or leave on) every light.</li>
<li><code>toggle 0,0 through 999,0</code> would toggle the first line of 1000 lights, turning off the ones that were on, and turning on the ones that were off.</li>
<li><code>turn off 499,499 through 500,500</code> would turn off (or leave off) the middle four lights.</li>
</ul>
<p>After following the instructions, <em>how many lights are lit</em>?</p>

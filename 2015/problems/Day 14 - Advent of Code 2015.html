Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; the easiest ones take 3-4 hours each, but the
harder ones take 6-8 hours, and a few even longer than that. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 14: Reindeer Olympics ---</h2><p>This
 year is the Reindeer Olympics!  Reindeer can fly at high speeds, but 
must rest occasionally to recover their energy.  Santa would like to 
know which of his reindeer is fastest, and so he has them race.</p>
<p>Reindeer can only either be <em>flying</em> (always at their top speed) or <em>resting</em> (not moving at all), and always spend whole seconds in either state.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have the following Reindeer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comet can fly <em>14 km/s for 10 seconds</em>, but then must rest for <em>127 seconds</em>.</li>
<li>Dancer can fly <em>16 km/s for 11 seconds</em>, but then must rest for <em>162 seconds</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After one second, Comet has gone 14 km, while Dancer has gone 16 km. 
 After ten seconds, Comet has gone 140 km, while Dancer has gone 160 km.
  On the eleventh second, Comet begins resting (staying at 140 km), and 
Dancer continues on for a total distance of 176 km.  On the 12th second,
 both reindeer are resting.  They continue to rest until the 138th 
second, when Comet flies for another ten seconds.  On the 174th second, 
Dancer flies for another 11 seconds.</p>
<p>In this example, after the 1000th second, both reindeer are resting, and Comet is in the lead at <em><code>1120</code></em> km (poor Dancer has only gotten <code>1056</code> km by that point).  So, in this situation, Comet would win (if the race ended at 1000 seconds).</p>
<p>Given the descriptions of each reindeer (in your puzzle input), after exactly <code>2503</code> seconds, <em>what distance has the winning reindeer traveled</em>?</p>

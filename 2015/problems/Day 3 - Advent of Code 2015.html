Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; the easiest ones take 3-4 hours each, but the
harder ones take 6-8 hours, and a few even longer than that. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum ---</h2><p>Santa is delivering presents to an infinite two-dimensional grid of houses.</p>
<p>He begins by delivering a present to the house at his starting 
location, and then an elf at the North Pole calls him via radio and 
tells him where to move next.  Moves are always exactly one house to the
 north (<code>^</code>), south (<code>v</code>), east (<code>&gt;</code>), or west (<code>&lt;</code>).  After each move, he delivers another present to the house at his new location.</p>
<p>However, the elf back at the north pole has had a little too much 
eggnog, and so his directions are a little off, and Santa ends up 
visiting some houses more than once.  How many houses receive <em>at least one present</em>?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&gt;</code> delivers presents to <code>2</code> houses: one at the starting location, and one to the east.</li>
<li><code>^&gt;v&lt;</code> delivers presents to <code>4</code> houses in a square, including twice to the house at his starting/ending location.</li>
<li><code>^v^v^v^v^v</code> delivers a bunch of presents to some very lucky children at only <code>2</code> houses.</li>
</ul>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>2592</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>The next year, to speed up the process, Santa creates a robot version of himself, <em>Robo-Santa</em>, to deliver presents with him.</p>
<p>Santa and Robo-Santa start at the same location (delivering two 
presents to the same starting house), then take turns moving based on 
instructions from the elf, who is <span title="This absolutely real word was invented by someone flipping eggnoggedly through a dictionary.">eggnoggedly</span> reading from the same script as the previous year.</p>
<p>This year, how many houses receive <em>at least one present</em>?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>^v</code> delivers presents to <code>3</code> houses, because Santa goes north, and then Robo-Santa goes south.</li>
<li><code>^&gt;v&lt;</code> now delivers presents to <code>3</code> houses, and Santa and Robo-Santa end up back where they started.</li>
<li><code>^v^v^v^v^v</code> now delivers presents to <code>11</code> houses, with Santa going one direction and Robo-Santa going the other.</li>
</ul>

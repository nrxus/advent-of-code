Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; the easiest ones take 3-4 hours each, but the
harder ones take 6-8 hours, and a few even longer than that. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 21: RPG Simulator 20XX ---</h2><p>Little <span title="The sky above the battle is the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.">Henry Case</span> got a new video game for Christmas.  It's an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game">RPG</a>, and he's stuck on a boss.  He needs to know what equipment to buy at the shop.  He hands you the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_controller">controller</a>.</p>
<p>In this game, the player (you) and the enemy (the boss) take turns 
attacking.  The player always goes first.  Each attack reduces the 
opponent's hit points by at least <code>1</code>.  The first character at or below <code>0</code> hit points loses.</p>
<p>Damage dealt by an attacker each turn is equal to the attacker's 
damage score minus the defender's armor score.  An attacker always does 
at least <code>1</code> damage.  So, if the attacker has a damage score of <code>8</code>, and the defender has an armor score of <code>3</code>, the defender loses <code>5</code> hit points.  If the defender had an armor score of <code>300</code>, the defender would still lose <code>1</code> hit point.</p>
<p>Your damage score and armor score both start at zero.  They can be 
increased by buying items in exchange for gold.  You start with no items
 and have as much gold as you need.  Your total damage or armor is equal
 to the sum of those stats from all of your items.  You have <em>100 hit points</em>.</p>
<p>Here is what the item shop is selling:</p>
<pre><code>Weapons:    Cost  Damage  Armor
Dagger        8     4       0
Shortsword   10     5       0
Warhammer    25     6       0
Longsword    40     7       0
Greataxe     74     8       0

Armor:      Cost  Damage  Armor
Leather      13     0       1
Chainmail    31     0       2
Splintmail   53     0       3
Bandedmail   75     0       4
Platemail   102     0       5

Rings:      Cost  Damage  Armor
Damage +1    25     1       0
Damage +2    50     2       0
Damage +3   100     3       0
Defense +1   20     0       1
Defense +2   40     0       2
Defense +3   80     0       3
</code></pre>
<p>You must buy exactly one weapon; no dual-wielding.  Armor is 
optional, but you can't use more than one.  You can buy 0-2 rings (at 
most one for each hand).  You must use any items you buy.  The shop only
 has one of each item, so you can't buy, for example, two rings of 
Damage +3.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have <code>8</code> hit points, <code>5</code> damage, and <code>5</code> armor, and that the boss has <code>12</code> hit points, <code>7</code> damage, and <code>2</code> armor:</p>
<ul>
<li>The player deals <code>5-2 = 3</code> damage; the boss goes down to 9 hit points.</li>
<li>The boss deals <code>7-5 = 2</code> damage; the player goes down to 6 hit points.</li>
<li>The player deals <code>5-2 = 3</code> damage; the boss goes down to 6 hit points.</li>
<li>The boss deals <code>7-5 = 2</code> damage; the player goes down to 4 hit points.</li>
<li>The player deals <code>5-2 = 3</code> damage; the boss goes down to 3 hit points.</li>
<li>The boss deals <code>7-5 = 2</code> damage; the player goes down to 2 hit points.</li>
<li>The player deals <code>5-2 = 3</code> damage; the boss goes down to 0 hit points.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this scenario, the player wins!  (Barely.)</p>
<p>You have <em>100 hit points</em>.  The boss's actual stats are in your puzzle input.  What is <em>the least amount of gold you can spend</em> and still win the fight?</p>

Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; the easiest ones take 3-4 hours each, but the
harder ones take 6-8 hours, and a few even longer than that. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 24: It Hangs in the Balance ---</h2><p>It's
 Christmas Eve, and Santa is loading up the sleigh for this year's 
deliveries.  However, there's one small problem: he can't get the sleigh
 to balance.  If it isn't balanced, he can't defy physics, and nobody 
gets presents this year.</p>
<p>No pressure.</p>
<p>Santa has provided you a list of the weights of every package he 
needs to fit on the sleigh.  The packages need to be split into <em>three groups of exactly the same weight</em>,
 and every package has to fit.  The first group goes in the passenger 
compartment of the sleigh, and the second and third go in containers on 
either side.  Only when all three groups weigh exactly the same amount 
will the sleigh be able to fly.  Defying physics has rules, you know!</p>
<p>Of course, that's not the only problem.  The first group - the one going in the passenger compartment - needs <em>as few packages as possible</em>
 so that Santa has some legroom left over.  It doesn't matter how many 
packages are in either of the other two groups, so long as all of the 
groups weigh the same.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Santa tells you, if there are multiple ways to arrange 
the packages such that the fewest possible are in the first group, you 
need to choose the way where the first group has <em>the smallest quantum entanglement</em> to reduce the chance of any <span title="Santa does not elaborate on what he means by this, but the cringe he makes indicates that it wouldn't be pretty.">"complications"</span>.  The quantum entanglement of a group of packages is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_%28mathematics%29">product</a>
 of their weights, that is, the value you get when you multiply their 
weights together.  Only consider quantum entanglement if the first group
 has the fewest possible number of packages in it and all groups weigh 
the same amount.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have ten packages with weights <code>1</code> through <code>5</code> and <code>7</code> through <code>11</code>.
  For this situation, some of the unique first groups, their quantum 
entanglements, and a way to divide the remaining packages are as 
follows:</p>
<pre><code>Group 1;             Group 2; Group 3
11 9       (QE= 99); 10 8 2;  7 5 4 3 1
10 9 1     (QE= 90); 11 7 2;  8 5 4 3
10 8 2     (QE=160); 11 9;    7 5 4 3 1
10 7 3     (QE=210); 11 9;    8 5 4 2 1
10 5 4 1   (QE=200); 11 9;    8 7 3 2
10 5 3 2   (QE=300); 11 9;    8 7 4 1
10 4 3 2 1 (QE=240); 11 9;    8 7 5
9 8 3      (QE=216); 11 7 2;  10 5 4 1
9 7 4      (QE=252); 11 8 1;  10 5 3 2
9 5 4 2    (QE=360); 11 8 1;  10 7 3
8 7 5      (QE=280); 11 9;    10 4 3 2 1
8 5 4 3    (QE=480); 11 9;    10 7 2 1
7 5 4 3 1  (QE=420); 11 9;    10 8 2
</code></pre>
<p>Of these, although <code>10 9 1</code> has the smallest quantum entanglement (<code>90</code>), the configuration with only two packages, <code>11 9</code>,
 in the passenger compartment gives Santa the most legroom and wins.  In
 this situation, the quantum entanglement for the ideal configuration is
 therefore <code>99</code>.  Had there been two configurations with only
 two packages in the first group, the one with the smaller quantum 
entanglement would be chosen.</p>
<p>What is the <em>quantum entanglement</em> of the first group of packages in the ideal configuration?</p>

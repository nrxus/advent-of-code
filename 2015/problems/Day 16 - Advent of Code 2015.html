Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  The best surprises don't
even appear in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles are most of the work; the easiest ones take 3-4 hours each, but the
harder ones take 6-8 hours, and a few even longer than that. A lot of effort
went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as much as I
enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

- Eric Wastl

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 16: Aunt Sue ---</h2><p>Your Aunt 
Sue has given you a wonderful gift, and you'd like to send her a thank 
you card.  However, there's a small problem: she signed it "From, Aunt 
Sue".</p>
<p>You have 500 Aunts named "Sue".</p>
<p>So, to avoid sending the card to the wrong person, you need to figure
 out which Aunt Sue (which you conveniently number 1 to 500, for sanity)
 gave you the gift.  You open the present and, as luck would have it, 
good ol' Aunt Sue got you a My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine!  Just
 what you wanted.  Or needed, as the case may be.</p>
<p>The My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine (MFCSAM for short) can 
detect a few specific compounds in a given sample, as well as how many 
distinct kinds of those compounds there are. According to the 
instructions, these are what the MFCSAM can detect:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>children</code>, by human DNA age analysis.</li>
<li><code>cats</code>.  It doesn't differentiate individual breeds.</li>
<li>Several <span title="It can tell them apart by their distinct Dog Residue.">seemingly random breeds of dog</span>: <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoyed_%28dog%29">samoyeds</a></code>, <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomeranian_%28dog%29">pomeranians</a></code>, <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akita_%28dog%29">akitas</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizsla">vizslas</a></code>.</li>
<li><code>goldfish</code>.  No other kinds of fish.</li>
<li><code>trees</code>, all in one group.</li>
<li><code>cars</code>, presumably by exhaust or gasoline or something.</li>
<li><code>perfumes</code>, which is handy, since many of your Aunts Sue wear a few kinds.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, many of your Aunts Sue have many of these.  You put the 
wrapping from the gift into the MFCSAM.  It beeps inquisitively at you a
 few times and then prints out a message on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticker_tape">ticker tape</a>:</p>
<pre><code>children: 3
cats: 7
samoyeds: 2
pomeranians: 3
akitas: 0
vizslas: 0
goldfish: 5
trees: 3
cars: 2
perfumes: 1
</code></pre>
<p>You make a list of the things you can remember about each Aunt Sue.  
Things missing from your list aren't zero - you simply don't remember 
the value.</p>
<p>What is the <em>number</em> of the Sue that got you the gift?</p>
